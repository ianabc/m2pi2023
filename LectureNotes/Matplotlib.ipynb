    "## Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm not an expert on visualization and it is a huge topic, so I'm only going to cover enough of the basics for the examples in this repository. I'll be using a system called [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), it isn't particularly exciting, but it is fairly flexible and very widely used. With a little coersion, you can usually get it to do what you need for publications etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is the defacto standard for visualization in python. It has been around for a long time, and it benefits from a large userbase, good documentation, [tutorials](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/index.html) and lots of easily copied examples! It is commonly imported with `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt` and `plt` is the state-based interface to matplotlib. If you've ever plotted in MATLAB it should be fairly familiar (actually, I think that's where the MAT in matplotlib comes from).\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is portable across systems. For this to work it uses the concept of \"backends\" which do the actual rendering of figures. These backends vary by operating system and other factors and all you need to do is tell matplotlib which one you would like to use. For the notebook interface there is a special magic command called `%matplotlib` which will do this for us. Most backends are hooks into specific windowing libraries or other utilities, but `inline` is a special backend which lets you display the results directly in the notebook.\n",

    "  * [plotly](https://plot.ly/python/ipython-notebook-tutorial/)\n",
    "  * [d3](https://d3js.org/)\n",
    "  \n",
    "Matplotlib actually has two interfaces for plotting, one is a more traditional stateful interace and the other takes an object oriented approach. We'll stick to the second one because while it is a little bit more verbose, it is more flexible and widely used. If you are looking at examples, you can normally tell which one they are using by checking to see if the call `plt.plot` or `ax.plot`. The OO interface gives you explicit figure and axes objects to attach things to so it doesn't depend as strongly on current cell context (this is useful if you want to modify more than one plot)"
