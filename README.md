# m2pi2023 Python Course Notes

The notebooks in this directory were used to support the 2023 edition of the PIMS Math^Industry workshop. The LectureNotes directory has some material covering 

  * [numpy](./LectureNotes/numpy.ipynb)
  * [pandas](./LectureNotes/Pandas.ipynb)
  * [matplotlib](./LectureNotes/Matplotlib.ipynb)

The intention is to give m2pi participants a foundation for tackling the industry problems they will face in the following weeks of m2pi.

There are various exercises available in the [ProblemSession](./ProblemSession) directory, specifically

  * [Car Pricing](./ProblemSession/CarPricing/CarPricing.ipynb)
  * [CruiseShips](./ProblemSession/CruiseShips/CruiseShip.ipynb)
  * [Flights](./ProblemSession/Flights/Flights.ipynb)
  * [Tour de France](./ProblemSession/TDF/TDF.ipynb)

All of the notebooks are currently shells waiting to be filled in, but we will go through some possibilities during the problem session and the resulting code will be added to this repo shortly.

Finally, there are also a couple of problem notebooks in the [PythonStdLib](./ProblemSession/PythinStdLib) directory. These are pure python exercises meant to accompany the [m2pi-python-self-study](https://github.com/ianabc/m2pi-python-self-study) course, they are not particularly relevant to the machine learning part of m2pi, but are included for completeness.
